# Selenium Tests
This is a repository with sample automated tests written in selenium
Older parts of the code I actually wrote before my break.
This is code that was written at the beginning of my adventure with Java and automated testing. 
It was mostly click-bait without any broader understanding of what such tests could check. 
A pure exercise of my understanding of the programming language and similar things
